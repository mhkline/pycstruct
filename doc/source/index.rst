pycstruct
=========

pycstruct is a python library for converting binary data to and from ordinary python dictionaries.

Typical usage of this library is read/write binary files or binary data transmitted over a network.

It supports all traditional data types (integer, unsigned integer, boolean and float) between 1 to 8 bytes large, arrays (lists) and strings (UTF-8).

Individual elements can be stored / read in any byte order.
